Kinetis Kxx GCC
--------

The bare-metal gcc startup for KINETIS K (Cortex M4). There are only few files thus this example is simple and easily editable and portable for any other kinetis k board. No drivers are included, clocks are initialized in the SystemInit function, the core clock - 96 MHz by default. No standard libs are needed for the startup.

There is GPIO demo for TWR-K60N512 and TWR-K20D72.
